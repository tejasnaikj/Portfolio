            <p>
                I am a final-year Computer Science undergraduate at PES University,
                Bengaluru, with hands-on experience in frontend systems, backend APIs,
                and database-driven applications.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I have built production-style projects using Python, Flask, MySQL,
                Redis, Docker, and Kubernetes, and I am seeking software engineering
                internships or entry-level roles.
            </p>
        </>
